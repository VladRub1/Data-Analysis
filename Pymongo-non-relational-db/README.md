# PyMongo â€” non-relational database

---

This project is about working with **non-relational databases** based 
on the `PyMongo` framework.

Here you can see **data analytics** for different data domains:
* student grades,
* posts in social networks,
* restaurant rating service,
* bank data on financial transactions

using direct _database queries_, as well as _writing_ to a non-relational 
database the results of executing other queries.

Project content:
* [Python_pymongo_non_relational_project.ipynb](./Python_pymongo_non_relational_project.ipynb):
  file with connection to the database, execution of queries, and analysis of their results
