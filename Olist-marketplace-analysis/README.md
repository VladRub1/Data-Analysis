# Olist marketplace analysis

---

This project focuses on _complex_ data analysis based on the performance 
data of the Brazilian marketplace [Olist](https://olist.com/pt-br/). 

It consists of different tasks that arise in data analyst tasks:
  * **[Dash](./Dash)**: the project consists of two parts: 
    1. Advanced _interactive visualization_ tasks with `plotly` library. 
       Including visualization of geodata about orders and shipments, 
       building time series based on order statistics, processing incorrect order data
    2. Building a full-fledged _analytical dashboard_ reflecting the process of doing 
       business and its results for making business 
       decisions based on data using the `dash` framework.
  * **[Pandas](./Pandas)**: analysis of quantitative and qualitative data 
    on orders in the marketplace (100 thousand), including analysis of the 
    best-selling products and their prices, analysis of the main areas of sellers' work, 
    distribution of sales by regions, analysis of customer feedback on products in 
    different sections.
  * **[Visualisation](./Visualisation)**: solving classical visualisation problems 
    with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, including analysis of factors determining the 
    number of product purchases and average customer bill, product reviews, types 
    of payment for orders, delivery time and its dependence on various factors.
  * **[Data](./Data)**: here you can download the order data used in the project 
    (as a single archive or all 9 tables individually). Below you can see the 
    relationships between the data (the file product_category_name_translation is 
    a translation of the category names from Portuguese to English).
